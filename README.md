Project Name = Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis
The Python Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to understand customer buying behavior during the Diwali festival. It uses a dataset that includes details like customer gender, age, occupation, state, and the amount they spent on different products. First, the data is cleaned by removing missing or unnecessary values to make it accurate for analysis. Then, the cleaned data is studied to find out who buys the most and what products are most popular.The analysis shows that most buyers are females, especially those aged between 26 and 35 years. Married women from IT, healthcare, and aviation professions spend the most during Diwali. Among all states, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka have the highest sales. The most popular product categories are clothing, food, and electronics.Overall, this project helps businesses understand customer preferences and plan better marketing strategies to increase sales during the festive season.
